Temperature indicates the direction in which heat energy will spontaneously flow—i.e., from a hotter body (one at a higher temperature) to a colder body (one at a lower temperature).</td>

The higher the humidity, the wetter it feels outside. On the weather reports, humidity is usually explained as relative humidity.</td>
